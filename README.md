<h1>Step 2</h1>

All of the SQLite tables within the selected database file should appear in the list widget on the right. In this mode, you can: rename any table without changing the data within the table, delete any table, or create a table and add it to your current database file.

If you want to change database files, simply click the "Close DB" button and repeat Step 1. If you want to view and edit information within a table, click the "Show Data" button.

<h1>Step 3</h1>

All of the data within your selected table will be shown in the table widget, while all of your column information will be shown in the list widget on the right. In this mode, you can: edit and replace data in your table through the table widget, rename columns without changing data within the column, delete columns, and add columns to your current table.

To save your changes made in the table widget, click the "Edit Data" button, and to see the changes you have made to your columns in your table widget, click the "Refresh" button. If you want to change to a different table in your current database file, click the "Exit Table" button and select a new table.

Essentially, this is a simplified version of the DB Browser desktop app.
